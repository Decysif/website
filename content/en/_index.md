description: "Formal verification in the service of safety and security"
synopsis: "DéCySif is a regional R&D project funded by an i-Démo call and the
Ile-de-France French region gathering Adacore, INRIA, OCamlPro and TrustInSoft.
Its objective is to improve the safety and security of critical systems using
formal verification tools."

project:
  sectiontitle: "The project"
  content: "It has been a few years since Rust has proven to be a viable
  alternative to languages such as Ada/C/C++ in the world of embedded software,
  critical or not. Current and upcoming actors of the Rust critical embedded
  software world are now exploring the possibility of using formal analysis
  tools for Rust.
  <br />
  <br />
  It is as a direct answer to that question that INRIA have developped Creusot, a
  tool for Rust. The tool itself is based off the same technological foundations
  as AdaCore's and TrustInSoft's formal analysis tools: the Why3 platform,
  developped by INRIA, and a collections of SMT-Solvers such as Alt-Ergo,
  developped by OCamlPro.
  <br />
  <br />
  Project DéCySif is the crucible for the improvement of all these tools and
  aims at guaranteeing convergence towards an optimal solution for the safety
  and security of embedded systems. "
