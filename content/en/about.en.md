# The project

It has been a few years since Rust has proven to be a viable alternative to
languages such as Ada/C/C++ in the world of embedded software, critical or not.

Current and upcoming actors of the Rust critical embedded software world are
now exploring the possibility of using formal analysis tools for Rust.

It is as a direct answer to that question that INRIA have developped Creusot, a
tool for Rust. The tool itself is based off the same technological foundations
as AdaCore's and TrustInSoft's formal analysis tools: the Why3 platform,
developped by INRIA, and a collections of SMT-Solvers such as Alt-Ergo,
developped by OCamlPro.

Project DéCySif is the crucible for the improvement of all these tools and aims
at guaranteeing convergence towards an optimal solution for the safety and
security of embedded systems.
