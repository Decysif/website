On Tuesday, December 19, 2023, all partners of the Decysif project
([TrustInSoft](https://trust-in-soft.com/),
[Adacore](https://www.adacore.com/), [OCamlPro](https://www.ocamlpro.com), and
the [LMF](https://lmf.cnrs.fr/) team) gathered at the TrustInSoft offices in
the 14th arrondissement of Paris for the project kickoff meeting!

It was a great opportunity to review the ambitious goals of the project, exchange
between partners about the organization and agenda of the work. The meeting ended,
as is often the case with these well-acquainted partners, with intense technical
discussions on the interaction between [Why3](https://www.why3.org/)
([repository](https://github.com/AdaCore/why3)) and
[Alt-Ergo](https://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com/)
([repository](https://github.com/OCamlPro/alt-ergo)), use cases for testing
Creusot, and techniques for detecting vulnerabilities using [TIS
Analyzer](https://www.trust-in-soft.com/trustinsoft-analyzer) ([repository of
the OS kernel](https://github.com/TrustInSoft/tis-kernel)) or Spark.
