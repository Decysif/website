---

We are thrilled to share that **Alt-Ergo 2.6** has officially been released!

Alt-Ergo is an automated prover developped by [OCamlPro](https://ocamlpro.com/)
widely used in formal verification and plays a key role in static analysis
frameworks like the [TIS
Analyzer](https://www.trust-in-soft.com/trustinsoft-analyzer) and
[Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/).

This latest version introduces a series of improvements and new features,
particularly in bit-vector reasoning, model generation, and optimization.

The updates in Alt-Ergo 2.6 are directly tied to the progress made in the
**DéCySif** joint research project between [AdaCore](https://www.adacore.com/),
[Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/toccata), OCamlPro, and
[TrustInSoft](https://www.trust-in-soft.com/).

### What's New?

- Enhanced support for **bit-vectors** and **algebraic data types**.
- New **optimization capabilities** to guide solver behavior.
- **Model generation** for a broader range of theories, including bit-vectors.

These updates are particularly valuable for those working on low-level code
verification, cryptography, or complex system debugging.

For a deeper dive into the release, including performance comparisons and
additional features, visit the full release notes over on [OCamlPro's
Blog](https://ocamlpro.com/blog/2024_09_01_alt_ergo_2_6_0_released/).
