On Thursday, March 13, 2025, all the partners of the Decysif project  
([TrustInSoft](https://trust-in-soft.com/),  
[AdaCore](https://www.adacore.com/), [OCamlPro](https://www.ocamlpro.com), and  
the [LMF](https://lmf.cnrs.fr/) team) gathered at the OCamlPro offices in  
Paris’s 14th arrondissement for the project’s plenary meeting!

It was the perfect occasion for these twenty engineers to come together and take  
stock of the progress on research topics, projects, and tools that are  
continuously growing and evolving!

It was also a great opportunity to review the remaining objectives and  
to discuss the organization and schedule of the work ahead.

As with the kickoff meeting, this session ended—as often happens among these  
well-acquainted partners—with intense technical discussions: on the interaction  
between [Why3](https://www.why3.org/) ([source code](https://github.com/AdaCore/why3))  
and [Alt-Ergo](https://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com/) ([source code](https://github.com/OCamlPro/alt-ergo)),  
on use cases for testing [Creusot (source code)](https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot),  
or on vulnerability detection techniques using  
[TIS Analyzer](https://www.trust-in-soft.com/trustinsoft-analyzer)  
([open-source kernel code](https://github.com/TrustInSoft/tis-kernel)) or  
[Spark](https://www.adacore.com/about-spark)  
([source code](https://github.com/AdaCore/spark2014)).
